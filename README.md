# Story of a Girl

A Babel plugin that replaces `this` with some lyrics.

Sorry. My hands were tied: https://twitter.com/luke_dot_js/status/876250000187170816

## Testing

I dunno, I barely know what Babel is. I just followed [a blog about it](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-asts-building-babel-plugin/).

And at any rate, this is going to be a terrible idea to use in real code. Don't. The license says you can't sue me, right? Talk to your lawyer.

Anyway, run `node run.js example.js` and fiddle w/ `example.js` to see what happens. I assume this does awful things.
